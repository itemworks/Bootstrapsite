				<p>
					Chickens are fascinating creatures with unique personalities and a strong sense of community within their flocks. Known for their distinct clucking and feathered bodies, chickens have been domesticated for thousands of years and are valued worldwide for both their eggs and meat. In backyard settings, chickens often display a surprising level of intelligence; they can recognize over 100 faces, including those of humans and other chickens. Despite their humble reputation, chickens play a critical role in agriculture, and their social behaviors—like establishing a "pecking order"—offer insight into social dynamics within animal groups. Plus, there's something undeniably charming about watching them scratch the ground, searching for tasty insects or grains to snack on.

				<p>
					A not-so-fun fact about beef is its significant environmental impact, especially when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. Beef production is responsible for a large amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, due to the digestive processes of cows. In fact, cattle farming accounts for roughly 65% of all livestock emissions, making beef one of the most environmentally taxing sources of protein. Additionally, producing beef requires a tremendous amount of water and land—about 1,800 gallons of water per pound—making it a resource-intensive choice that can contribute to deforestation and habitat loss as more land is cleared for grazing and feed crops.

				<span class="banner" id="sushi">Sushi</span>
				<p>
					The sushi industry, while globally beloved, has a darker side marked by environmental strain, health risks, and ethical issues. Overfishing, especially of Bluefin tuna, endangers species, while bycatch and waste add to ecosystem damage. Mislabeling is common, with cheaper fish often substituted for premium varieties, sometimes causing health issues. Sushi-grade shrimp may involve labor exploitation, and raw fish often contains microplastics due to ocean pollution. Farmed fish come with added concerns like synthetic dyes and antibiotics, while sushi rice in cheaper spots may be processed with additives. Even the “fresh” fish may carry pathogens or high mercury levels, presenting hidden risks for frequent consumers
